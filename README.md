# What is this?

Welcome! You probably clicked a link in my email signature that told you that you don’t need to reply right now.

# Why don’t I need to reply right now?

I support and encourage flexible working.

* If you got this email outside of your usual working time, I don’t expect a response until you are working again.
* If you are in the middle of deep work, or catching a deadline, I don’t expect you to respond immediately.
 
What does this all mean? You work the hours that suit you - whether that’s 9-5, 12-8, or something else entirely! I don’t expect you to work outside of the hours that you choose to work.

For me, my hours are normally 10am-6pm, Monday to Friday, US Eastern Time. But that’s not set in stone. I value my work-life balance and therefore those hours might shift a bit. I also travel quite a bit for work - so I have to adjust across time zones.

Similarly, sometimes I batch my email activities so responses may be delayed a few hours.

# What about when I send emails? Do I need to consider that you might not be at work?

Don’t worry. Send the email! I will respond when I am next at work.

# What if it's time sensitive?

Feel free to message me directly. I'm usually more attentive there, but again, if I'm heads down on a task I may have turned "Do not disturb" mode on and silenced notifications. I'll get back as soon as I can.

Also know that because my hours, especially when traveling, are very non-traditionally 9-5 I may direct message on chat outside of regular 9-5 hours. Know that I'm always thinking about your local time zone and by no means do I expect a reply at whatever strange hour I'm messaging you. It's usually just so I don't forget to ask in the morning (and I'm often forgetful), so get to it when you can. If it truly is time sensitive, I'll let you know.

# This was a journey. What do I do now?

Go back to doing whatever it was you were doing before you came here! Just don’t feel pressured to reply to my email straight away.

# Why is Trogdor in the repository?

I just noticed that, and I honestly have no clue. [Trogdor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90X5NJleYJQ) is awesome though, burninating the countryside and all, so he stays.
